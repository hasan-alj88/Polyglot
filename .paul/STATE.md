## Accumulated Context

### Decisions
| Decision | Date | Impact |
|----------|------|--------|
| Reset to documentation-first approach | 2026-03-12 | All Rust code deleted; focus on spec, architecture, and research before coding |
| Removed BMAD agent infrastructure | 2026-03-12 | Only PAUL remains as project management framework |
| Polly to be rebuilt as PAUL flow | 2026-03-12 | Language expert agent will return as a PAUL special flow |
| Archive docs before deleting (checkpoint) | 2026-03-12 | Created tarballs instead of permanent deletion |
| New documentation standards (v2.0) | 2026-03-12 | Replaced BMAD conventions with audience-based system (User/Tech/Audit), YAML indexes, 50KB limit, 7 templates |
| Archive Agile/ and v0.0.5/ | 2026-03-12 | Historical BMAD-era content archived to tarballs; v0.0.5 premature |
| uv environment for Python tooling | 2026-03-12 | PyYAML added to pyproject.toml; validation scripts use pydantic |
| Migrate docs on touch, not batch | 2026-03-12 | New files must comply; legacy files migrate when modified |
| Added Phase 5: Clean Slate Reset | 2026-03-12 | Extends milestone scope — commit all pending changes, remove tarballs, clean git state |
| Wiped docs/ to skeleton | 2026-03-12 | User wants to write spec from scratch via draft loop, not consolidate existing docs |
| Scrapped Plan 02-01 | 2026-03-12 | Old plan consolidated scattered docs; new approach: fresh writing via /paul:draft |
| Rescoped Plan 02-01 | 2026-03-12 | Core Principles → Project Vision & Philosophy; covers whole project not just language rules |

### Deferred Issues
- Rebuild Polly as PAUL special flow (after documentation phases)

### Blockers/Concerns
None.

## Boundaries (Active)

Protected elements for current milestone:
- docs/ directory (existing documentation to build on)
- .paul/ directory (project management)

## Session Continuity

Last session: 2026-03-12
Stopped at: Documentation standards v2.0 established; Plan 02-01 approved, APPLY not started
Next action: Run /paul:apply to start Plan 02-01
Resume context:
- docs/ wiped to skeleton (only draft.md remains)
- Plan 02-01: Project Vision & Philosophy via /paul:draft loop
- 10 plans total for Phase 2 (vision first, then language topics)
- All prior doc content available in git history if needed
